            <h5>What is "rushing"?</h5>
            <p class="rushinginfo">
            Rushing is an open invitation for eligible students to start the process of becoming a member of Theta Tau. It is a chance to meet the members and find out what "pledging" and the fraternity are all about. At the University of Michigan Dearborn, Rush happens during the first two full weeks of classes of the Fall and Winter semesters. During these two weeks, students are encouraged to stop by our Rush table and introduce themselves to the members and ask any questions they may have about Theta Tau. If the student is interested, he may "rush" the fraternity by signing up as a prospective "pledge" of Theta Tau - here is still NO OBLIGATION to the student or the fraternity. Signing up simply indicates that the student is interested in the fraternity and would like more information. All "rushees" should recieve at least one phone call by an active member of Theta Tau to discuss any questions, issues or concerns that the student has about the fraternity or becoming a member. At the end of the rush period, the members of Theta Tau vote on who is allowed to take the next step towards becoming a member of Theta Tau. Upon receiving a positive vote, the student will be contacted and asked if he would like to pledge Theta Tau.

            <h5>What is "pledging"?</h5>
            <p class="rushinginfo">Pledging Theta Tau is a continuing promise by the student to become an active member of Theta Tau. A "pledge" is a person who has made this promise and his promise has been accepted by all the members of Theta Tau. The "pledge period" lasts for the remaining 8-10 weeks of the semester. It is a time for all the active members of Theta Tau to get to know the students that are pledging AND for the students to get to know the members of Theta Tau and the background of Theta Tau at large. Throughout the pledge period, different requirements are asked of the pledges. At any point in the pledge period, any student may be removed from pledging at any time by either the student himself or Theta Tau with no obligations to either party thereafter. At the end of the pledge period, if the existing students have met all the requirements as asked of them, an anonimous vote is taken by the active members before any pledge is given the choice to accept membership into Theta Tau. Each student is voted on individually and must acquire a unanimous vote in favor of his membership.</p>
            <h5>What are the requirements of pledging?</h5>
            <p class="rushinginfo">During the pledge period, pledges are expected to:</p>
			<ul class="reqs">
				<li>Sustain an Engineering GPA of no less than 2.0, per the requirements of the School of Engineering.</li>
				<p class="rushinginfo" id="exception"><strong>There will be NO EXCEPTION to this requirement.</strong></p>
				<li>Get to know each of the active members, proof of which will be shown by the signature of each member.</li>
				<p class="rushinginfo" id="exception"><strong>There will be NO EXCEPTION to this requirement.</strong></p>
				<li>Attend the weekly Theta Tau meetings.</li>
				<li>Attend weekly pledge meetings.</li>
				<li>Attend any Theta Tau sanctioned events.</li>
				<li>Successful completion of general projects.</li>
				<li>Pay a monthly pledging fee. Pledging fees are payed to help alleviate the cost incurred by the fraternity for National administration duties and any events specific to the pledge period.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="rushinginfo">The members of Theta Tau understand that not all events and/or meetings can be attended 100% of the time. Therefore, what is expected and required is that a student makes <strong>every effort</strong> to be as active as possible in his pledge period. In many cases, attending classes, homework and studying often times may conflict with the pledging schedule and therefore special considerations must be taken into account. <em>A student's grades are always a first priority!</em></p>
			<h5>Does Theta Tau haze?</h5>
			<p class="rushinginfo">No, we do not haze in any way or form. Furthermore, hazing is banned on the UM-Dearborn campus. Theta Tau does not force its pledges to do anything that goes against his beliefs or general habits.</p>
			<h5>Are members of Theta Tau on campus often?</h5>
			<p class="rushinginfo">Yes! The members of Theta Tau have classes as do the rest of the students. Since many members wear Theta Tau paraphenalia, including hats, jackets, hockey jerseys and t-shirts, it is usually easy to spot them.
